<p>OUR VISION</p><br>
<p class="p1">This institution named after and inspired by the world famous story of “Anne of Green Gables”, an orphan whose simple yet colorful life was filled with innocence and curiosity has touched the hearts of many. Thus, it is our aim to reach out to the children of our community to provide them with skillful and professional training and discipline founded on paternal care, strong values, and love of God.</p><br>
<p>OUR MISSION</p><br>
<p class="p1">As much as we are dedicated to equip the normal children with the best education that will make them them excel in life, we are as well bound with a mission to nurture and develop in fullness the capabilities of “special children” and to make them feel and realize their role and importance in our world, where they belong with us.</p><br>
